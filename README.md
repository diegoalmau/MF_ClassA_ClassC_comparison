# MF_ClassA_ClassC_comparison
In this code, I analyzed the difference in the comission structure of Class A and Class C mutual funds. The sample is composed of more than 28 Class A Mutual Funds, each with its respective Class C (~58 mutual funds).

The data is extracted from Bloomberg, stored in an Excel file and loaded in the Python script via read_excel()

The results are compiled in a paper written by me.
